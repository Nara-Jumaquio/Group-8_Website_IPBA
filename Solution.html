<h1><center>Indentified Solution</center></h1>
<h3><center>We had many identified solutions which were:</center></h3>
<p>Let teenagers or adults have a choice in marriage.</p>
<p>Listen to people who have different opinions on marriage.</p>
<p>Change the system of marriage.</p>
<p>Respect the rights and the decisions of the people entering the marriage.</p>
<p>Get educated on why this marriage system is not proper or ethical.</p>
<p>Gathered some ideas from adults about marriage, what it is all about, and what you can do after/before you get married.</p>

<h1><center>Final Solution</center></h1>
<p><center>We brainstormed and decided that our solution will be Awareness Campaign. We would do this Either through posters to provide information that will educate the people about why this marriage system is improper or ethical. We could also use newspapers to spread this information about why marriage can have very negative effects and by interviewing local citizens that think that this marriage is bad it might spread quickly throughout the country</center></p>
