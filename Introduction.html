<p class="paragraph">Forced marriage is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without their consent or against their will. A marriage can also become a forced marriage even if both parties enter with full consent if one or both are later forced to stay in the marriage against their will.A forced marriage differs from an arranged marriage, in which both parties presumably consent to the assistance of their parents or a third party such as a matchmaker in finding and choosing a spouse. There is often a continuum of coercion used to compel a marriage, ranging from outright physical violence to subtle psychological pressure.

<p class="paragraph">Parents believe that a groom/bride-to-be from respected families is brought up well, so, their child will be respected as well. Forced Marriage also occurs because of an agreement made by elders or parents ~ that their children will be married in the future, even if the groom or bride-to-be was not yet born when the agreement was made. The parents pushed for this marriage out of respect for their elders and out of respect for the agreement made.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Forced and early marriage are most common in impoverished states in Africa, South Asia as well as the former Soviet republics. However, there are still cases of forced and early marriage in more affluent North American and European countries. Forced marriage can be coupled with other forms of slavery.

<p class="paragraph">There are many Defenitions of Forced Marriages
<br>Forced marriages are marriages conducted without the valid consent of both parties, where physical or emotional coercion is a factor. In 2017, the International Labor Organization designated forced marriage as a form of modern slavery.

<br>Child marriages are marriages in which one or both partners are under the age of 18, and they often hinder survivors’ access to health, education, and opportunity. Many child marriages are forced marriages arranged by parents or family members without considering the consent of the child.

<br>Arranged marriages are an alliance or contract between two families who take the lead role in selecting a partner for their adult children, who ostensibly can meaningfully consent to, or reject their parents’ choices. Historically, these alliances between families served to safeguard and control property rights, inheritance and wealth transfers, lineage, etc.

<br>Minor girls and young adult women are overwhelmingly victims of forced marriages. Sons who resist an arranged marriage, have a partner the parents disapprove of, or are gay, may be coerced or tricked into a forced marriage.
</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Every type of marriage has its ups and downs but it is generally preferred not to use forced marriage because of the effect it has on the bride and groom. Forced marriage is generally not preferred however there are some advantages when using forced marriage such as guaranteed family line, better family connections, etc.
